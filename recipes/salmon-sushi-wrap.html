    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>How to make a salmon sushi wrap combine with Vietnamese rice paper.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The rice paper should be small sized, measuring 16 cm (6 in) in diameter.</li>
      <li>You can either use Japanese nori, or Korean roasted seaweed snacks.</li>
      <li>Cut them into small rectangles measuring 4 by 3 cm (1.6 by 1.2 in).</li>
      <li>To make seasoned sushi rice, mix in 2 tbsp rice vinegar, 1 tsp sugar, 1/4 tsp salt to 3 cups sushi rice.</li>
      <li>You can customize the filling to your liking.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li class="steps-list">
        <h4>Prepare the fillings</h4>
        <p>To a chopping board, shred the imitation crab with two forks, place into a bowl and mix in Kewpie mayo. Then, julienne the cucumber into thin matchsticks, measuring 3 inches. Finally, thinly slice the avocado, around 1/3 the size of your pinky tip.</p>
        <p>With the sushi rice, season it with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. For the seaweed sheets, cut into 3 by 4 cm (1.2 by 1.6 in) rectangles.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="steps-list">
        <h4>Stack the fillings onto rice paper</h4>
        <p>Dip a sheet of rice paper into room temp water for 10 seconds, and place onto a dry surface. Place a sheet of seaweed in the centre of the rice paper, followed by 2 tablespoon of seasoned sushi rice. Wet your fingertips and mould the rice into a 3 by 2 inch rectangle.</p>
        <p>For the toppings, take 1 tbsp of the creamy imitation crab, spreading it evenly over the rice. Grab some 8 strips of julienne cucumber placing it flat on top. Finally, slide on 3 slices of avocado.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="steps-list">
        <h4>Wrap the filling with the rice paper into a roll</h4>
        <p>Bring the bottom portion of the rice paper up, the right side to left, the left side to right, and then roll it up, all the while tucking in any filling falling out.</p>
        <p>

      </li>
      <li class="steps-list">
        <h4>Optional: Pan-fry until crispy</h4>
        <p>Grab a nonstick pan, and add some vegetable oil until it thinly fills the entire pan (around 1 mm of oil), turn the heat to medium-high, and slide the rolls in. Shallow fry them on both sides until crispy – it’ll be around 30 seconds on each side.</p>
        <p>Once they’re golden and crisp, transfer them to a cutting board, and as they cool down a bit, make a quick dipping sauce.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="steps-list">
        <h4>Garnish with sesame seeds and pair with dipping sauce</h4>
        <p>Garnish the non-fried sushi rolls with a pinch of sesame seeds. Pair the Rice Paper Sushi Rolls with the Spicy Sriracha Aioli. Serve immediately as the crispy rolls will turn soggy at the 10 mins mark.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
